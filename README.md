Network Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains a curated portfolio of network architecture designs, operational documentation, and lab environments demonstrating enterprise network engineering and infrastructure practices.

The focus of this portfolio is not vendor-specific configuration dumps, but design rationale, operational discipline, and decision-making in real-world enterprise environments. All content is either lab-based or fully sanitized to avoid disclosure of proprietary or sensitive information.

Background Context

My professional background spans hands-on network engineering, infrastructure operations, and IT project delivery. I work in mixed environments that include:

- Enterprise on-prem infrastructure
- Virtualized platforms (including Nutanix AHV)
- Windows and Linux server ecosystems
- Security tooling and endpoint protection platforms
- Operationally mature environments with change control and audit requirements

I place strong emphasis on documentation quality, risk management, and repeatable processes. This portfolio reflects how I approach design and operations in production environments, not just theoretical labs.

Repository Structure Overview

- architectures
  Enterprise and site-level network designs, including logical and physical architectures, routing strategies, and redundancy models.

- security
  Network segmentation models, firewall policy strategies, VPN designs, and security-focused architectural considerations.

- operations
  Change management examples, monitoring and alerting designs, and incident post-mortem documentation.

- labs
  Isolated lab environments used to validate routing, redundancy, and security concepts without production risk.

- automation
  Network-adjacent automation examples and infrastructure tooling integrations where appropriate.

- about
  High-level professional summary and skills overview.

Recommended Starting Points

For reviewers or interviewers, the following sections best represent how I think and work:

- architectures/enterprise-campus-network
- security/network-segmentation
- operations/incident-response

Each document follows a consistent structure covering objectives, assumptions, design decisions, risks, validation steps, and future improvements.

Sanitization Notice

All diagrams, IP addressing, hostnames, and identifiers are fictional or generalized. Any resemblance to real environments is coincidental. This repository is intended solely to demonstrate technical approach and professional methodology.

Usage

This portfolio may be shared selectively for interview, review, or professional development purposes. It is not intended to represent any specific employer or customer environment.
